The plate in this directory is compatible with toolheads designed for the XOL carriage. This includes A4T and XOL toolheads. It is compatible with standard MadMax carriages, and also with the version in this directory.

The carriage in this directory is for mounting Cartographer, Beacon, and mechanically compatible eddy-current probes on front-mounted MGN12 rails.

"Alternate Bracket" merges the dock bracket and toolhead board standoff from the plate. It's stiffer and results in cleaner tool changes, if it fits with your toolhead (works with A4T, not tested with XOL).

These parts are extensively tested on a Voron Trident 350.
